  <h1>Freezer Full of Feet</h1>
  
  <p> 
  Freezer Full of Feet is a shared space for writing that's erotic, literary, experimental. Stuff that's too intense for regular life.
  </p>

  We're leading off with an excerpt from Damon Ketcher and Lynn Selkie's forthcoming novel <i> Inside Snug and Evil </i> (working title). To change things up - here's a reading to go with the text.
  </p>
 
  <p>  This chapter, "Knees," finds Lynn in a vulnerable position at dawn. Will the tables turn? Stay tuned. </p>

  Pressure everywhere. Cold floorboards pressed up into her knees. His hand pressed on the back of her neck. The other hand gripped her hair, and the pull on the strands was a needle-clamp feeling on the scalp, an authority that made the rest of her limp as a kitten in its mother's jaw.
  </p>
  <p>
  She looked up and his gaze pressed down against her skin like a weight. All of it held her in place while he used her. 
  </p>
  <p>
  His face was difficult to read - jaw set, eyes hard, but also… something. What the fuck was it? <i>Sad, angry, excited? All those things…</i> 
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>The face of a man watching his house burn down, warming his hands against the flames.</i>
