  <h2>Freezer Full of Feet</h2>
  
  <p> 
  Freezer Full of Feet is a space for work that's erotic, literary, and experimental. Stuff that's too intense for regular life.

  We're leading off with an excerpt from Damon Ketcher and Lynn Selkie's forthcoming novel <i> Inside Snug and Evil </i> (working title). To change things up - here's an audio reading by Damon Ketcher.
  </p>

  "Pressure everywhere. Cold floorboards pressed up into her knees. His hand pressed on the back of her neck. The other hand gripped her hair, and the pull on the strands was a needle-clamp feeling on the scalp, an authority that made the rest of her limp as a kitten in its mother's jaw.
  </p>
  <p>
  She looked up and his gaze pressed down against her skin like a weight. All of it held her in place while he used her. 
  </p>
  <p>
  His face was difficult to read - jaw set, eyes hard, but also… something. <i>What the fuck was it? Sad, angry, excited? All those things…</i>
